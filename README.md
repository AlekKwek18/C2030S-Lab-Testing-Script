# C2030S-Lab-Testing-Script

"check.sh" enables you to test for your CS2030S lab with ease.

The script will compile your LabX.java and run all the test cases as well as specific test cases automatically so that you can debug effectively. 

For initial setup, run this command to set permission of the script to execute: `chmod +x check.sh`

**Usage:**

To simply use, run the command: `./check.sh`

To check specific input, enter the following: `./check.sh INPUT_CASE_NUMBER`

For example, running: `./check.sh 7`

prints the input, output, and expected output for case 7.
