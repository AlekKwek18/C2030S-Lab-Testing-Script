# C2030S-Lab-Testing-Script

"check.sh" enables you to test for your CS2030S lab easily.

The script will compile your LabX.java and automatically run all the test cases and specific test cases so that you can debug effectively.

For initial setup, run this command to set the permission of the script to execute: `chmod +x check.sh`

**Usage:**

To use, run the command: `./check.sh`

To check specific input, enter the following: `./check.sh INPUT_CASE_NUMBER`

For example, running: `./check.sh 7`

prints the input, output, and expected output for case 7.
